# Tested systems
I mainly tested the program on windows, but I don't see a problem with linux distributions, but I know that there are/were issues with tkinter under ubuntu.

There can be problems with a venv and tkinter, if the program trows an error like ```Can't find a usable init.tcl``` try to install it with normal pip instead of pipx.
